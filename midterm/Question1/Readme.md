Performed Analysis on Enron data-set

Analysis-1
------------

ANDREW FASTOW, the CFO of Enron was one on the main culprits and I analyzed with whom he was in contact and to whom he has been sending emails and recieving them from and the analysis states that:

The number of emails sent to Andrew Fastow is 159
The number of emails Andrew Fastow sent is 3

On analyzing it further I checked who sent the most number of emails to Andrew and vice versa.The analysis gave the fact that:

Andrew sent most number of emails to greg.whalley@enron.com
Andrew recieved most number of emails from joannie.williamson@enron.com

It can be analyzed that Andrew Fastow dint sent out many emails but he did sent out 3 emails and 2 of them were for greg.whalley@enron.com.Hence I decided to analyze it further to findout major keywords and talked about things in these 2 emails.

I analyzed the word frequency of the content of emails to fetch some useful information and It can be noticed that the Most talked about words in these emails are "PETROBRAS" "meeting" "MONDAY" "November" and According to the research it was found out that the Enron Corp. and Petrobras, Brazil's big, government-owned oil and gas business, have formed a partnership in the month of November on Monday.
