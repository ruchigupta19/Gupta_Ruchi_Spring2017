# Performed Analysis on Enron data-set

## Analysis-1


**ANDREW FASTOW**, the CFO of Enron was one on the main culprits and I analyzed **with whom he was in contact and to whom he has been sending emails and recieving them from** and the analysis states that:

- The number of emails sent to Andrew Fastow is 159
- The number of emails Andrew Fastow sent is 3

On analyzing it further I checked **who sent the most number of emails to Andrew and vice versa**.The analysis gave the fact that:

- Andrew sent most number of emails to greg.whalley@enron.com
- Andrew recieved most number of emails from joannie.williamson@enron.com

It can be analyzed that Andrew Fastow dint sent out many emails but he did sent out 3 emails and 2 of them were for **greg.whalley@enron.com**.Hence I decided to analyze it further to **findout major keywords and talked about things** in these 2 emails.

I analyzed the word frequency of the content of emails to fetch some useful information and It can be noticed that the Most talked about words in these emails are **"PETROBRAS" "MEETING" "MONDAY" "NOVEMBER"** and According to the research it was found out that the Enron Corp. and Petrobras, Brazil's big, government-owned oil and gas business, have formed a partnership in the month of November on Monday.

## Analysis -2 

This span of this data is over the years and I am analzying **in which month and year most number of emails has been sent and deleted**

So the most useful data recieved from this analysis is that the maximum number of emails were deleted in **OCT 2011** and from the records its visible that in October only, the first article appeared which revealed the details of Fastow's partnerships and shows the precarious nature of Enron's business and **the SEC begins an informal probe of Enron.Hence, people at Enron carried out a massive operation of destroying tons of documents including emails**
